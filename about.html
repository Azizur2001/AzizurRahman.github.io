        <h2>Azizur Rahman</h2>
        <p>My name is Azizur Rahman, and I am an enthusiastic senior at Queens College,
            where I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
            My journey in tech began in high school with an early fascination in Python programming, sparking a deep interest that has since guided my academic path. As technology continues to evolve rapidly, my eagerness to engage with and contribute to this dynamic field only grows stronger.
            Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests that balance my life. I am an avid football (soccer) player and enjoy immersing myself in the world of video games. Quality time with family and friends is precious to me, and I cherish these moments deeply. While I might describe myself as reserved, college life has significantly enhanced my communication skills, allowing me to express myself more freely and confidently.
            My passion for entertainment is wide-ranging, encompassing a love for movies, Anime, and reading mangas. I am also an enthusiast of travel and exploration, though my experiences in this realm are just beginning. I eagerly anticipate expanding my horizons and exploring new destinations in the near future..</p>
